CD2MP3 1.10  (C) 1998 Samuel Audet <guardia@cam.org>

Initially, I made a simple REXX script that used Leech and L3Enc 1.0 for
OS/2 to easily dump a part of a CD to MP3, but it then became more complex
with ToMPG (which is nonetheless 7 times faster than L3Enc!!) converted
with Win32-OS/2.

First, there is no way Win32-OS/2 consoles can currently close on
completion, so there is no way in hell I can wait for a program that never
closes.  So I made a C proggy that could start a child session of ToMPG and
checked its window's title bar for "Completed". Of course, that didn't work
either.  It traps in "REGISTRY.DLL".  So the only solution left was to
start it as an independant session and hope everything goes well while
CD2MP3 constantly queries and checks the Window List for something
containing "tompg", "Completed" and the MP3 filename.  It then kills the
session it finds and continues with the next track.  Of course, if you
close ToMPG window, CD2MP3 will never end.

Requirements
============

Leech  http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/mmedia/sound/editors/leech120.zip

Win32-OS/2 to convert ToMPG.  http://www.os2ss.com/win32-os2

ToMPG, which can be found on many sites.  MP3 PM author also keeps it on
his webpage.  http://www.kiss.uni-lj.si/~k4fe0470/tompg.zip


Legal stuff
===========

I'm NOT responsible if your computer burns (or if anything else happens)
while using this program.


History
=======

1.10  May 2, 1998
----

- Added a feature to reverse channels of the WAV file generated by leech.
  Useful if your CD-ROM drive reverses channel on CD-DA (believe me, check
  your drive to see if it does it also)
- Added different directory support for WAV and MP3 files.
- Added "failsafe" errorlevel return code check up after execution of Leech.
  If Leech returns 0 even if something bad happened, it'll be its fault not
  reporting the error properly -> contact Leech author.

1.04  May 1, 1998
----

- On request, CD2MP3 now also supports MP3Enc, although I find it pretty
  slow (as slow as L3Enc) and I find it generates worse MP3s than ToMPG.
- CD2MP3 now launchs the encoders in idle priority by default.

1.03  April 29, 1998
----

- CD2MP3 actually deletes the WAV file again.

1.02  April 28, 1998
----

- Oops, basename now works with spaces.

1.01  April 27, 1998
----

- Now starting ToMPG with the environmental variable to disable Win32-OS/2
  logging.
